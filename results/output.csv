ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Peritonitis, anastomotic leak, acute
abdomen.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post exploratory laparotomy.
2.  Lysis of adhesions.
3.  Diverting ostomy and repair of anastomotic leak.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 35654**] is a 58-year-old
man with multiple polyps in his colon who underwent a total
abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis on [**12-8**].
Initial postoperative course was complicated by bleeding
requiring urgent re-exploration on the night of surgery.  He
was discharged to home two days prior to admission tolerating
regular diet, however, upon returning to his home he began to
have crampy abdominal pain, did not pass any flatus or bowel
movements and returned to the Emergency Room with distention.
He denies nausea, vomiting, but did have fevers and no
chills.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **]
syndrome, multiple polyps in the colon, peptic ulcer disease,
alcohol abuse.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  As above.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin ""makes him sick"".

MEDICATIONS:  Loperamide, Protonix, Roxicet and pancreatic
enzymes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, significant for
temperature of 101.2, pulse 148, pressure of 102/68.  Heart
rate was regular.  Lungs were clear.  Abdomen was severely
distended with palpable loops of small bowel.  There was
guarding and rebound, left greater than right lower quadrant,
no shakes, no palpable hernias.  Rectal was heme negative.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant for white count of 45, LFTs
were normal.  Amylase and lipase were normal.  Coags were
normal.  Abdominal x-ray showed free air into the diaphragm
and dilated loops of small bowel.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the operating
room where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of
adhesions, ostomy repair of an anastomotic leak.  He was
taken from the operating room to the SICU where he remained
intubated overnight.  He was extubated without difficulty the
following morning, remained in the SICU for observation and
was transferred out to the floor on postoperative day #2.
Once on the floor, he was started on TPN.  Physical therapy
began to follow the patient.  His course was relatively
uncomplicated on the floor.  He had delayed ostomy function
and was maintained on TPN with npo status on Fluconazole,
Flagyl and Levofloxacin for antibiotics.  His intra-abdominal
cultures grew out organisms consistent with fecal soilage of
the peritoneal cavity.  Blood and urine cultures remained
negative throughout his stay.  Once on the floor he had
really no acute issues.  His bowels, as I mentioned, were
slow to return to function, however, once ileostomy started
to work he had no interruption in function.  His diet was
advanced slowly to sips, then clears, then a regular diet
which he was tolerating well by the time of discharge.  He
continued to work physical therapy, was found to be quite
weak, however, was able to ambulate about the floor without
difficulty.  He received ostomy training and became
comfortable, taking care of his ileostomy.  He is being
discharged on postoperative day #15.  His antibiotics had
been off for 24 hours and he remained afebrile.  He is being
discharged with his staples and will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately one weeks time for staple
removal.

Of note, the patient was on a Somatostatin drip for
approximately a week to slow down his NG tube output,
however, once his ileostomy started to consistently function,
he continued with elevated NG output.  KUB confirmed
placement of the NG tube in the stomach and it was decided
that clamping trials would be initiated.  His residuals after
four hours of clamping were 55 and 10 and NG tube was removed
without difficulty.  The patient does have significant reflux
disease and intermittently had trouble with his reflex,
however, never had any evidence of bowel obstruction and
tolerated his diet throughout.  He is being discharged to
home on Protonix, Imodium prn and Tylenol for pain medication
as well as his preoperative medications.  He will receive
visiting nurse services.

Service:  Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old
gentleman with complaints of headache on and off since Friday
before admission.  On Friday before admission the patient had
a severe headache which resolved on its own.  It recurred on
Sunday and Monday.  The patient had a head CT at that time
which was negative.  Tuesday night he complained of severe
headache while climbing the stairs, went back to the
hospital, had an LP which showed in tube #4, red cells were
[**Pager number **], white cells were 1.1, red cells in tube #1 were 339,
protein was 25, glucose 69.  The patient was found to be
severely hypertensive and diaphoretic with systolic blood
pressure over 220.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was monitored in the surgical Intensive
Care Unit.  He had a CT of his brain which was negative.  He
went for an arteriogram.  On [**11-2**] the patient had an
arteriogram which was negative for any evidence of aneurysm
or AV malformation. The patient had an MRI of his C spine
which was also negative and patient was transferred to the
regular floor where he was stable neurologically with just
complaints of headache.  He was treated with pain medication.
His headache slowly resolved.  He was awake, alert, oriented
times three, moving all extremities strongly.  Denies
dizziness, visual changes, numbness or tingling or weakness.
The patient was discharged to home on [**2101-11-7**] neurologically
stable with follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in [**4-17**] weeks time.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Percocet 1-2 tabs po q 6 hours prn

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness, arm tingling, weakness, and LLE weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Head CT

History of Present Illness:
58 yo man with h/o DMII, HTN, and metastatic rectal cancer with
metastases to the lung, liver, and cerebellum presents with
worsened unsteadiness and 2 episodes of left sided tingling, and
possible dysarthria.

He initially had his cerebellar mets diagnosed due to headache
on a CT in [**2118-10-20**] and had a VP shunt placed by neurosurgery. He
was started on decadron as well to taper at home. He had
continued unsteadiness, but walked around with a cane okay. He
reports that for the last 2 weeks, he has had worsened
unsteadiness and has been very tired, sleeping a lot. He says he
thinks this is
due to his XRT treatments which finished 6 days prior to
admission. He has not fallen.

Then, the day of presentation, he was at home and had the
gradual onset of tingling in his RUE with no [**Month (only) **] that lasted
1.5 hours. This came on slowly over 20-25 minutes. When it was
present he also felt his arm was very weak and he could not lift
it. He also had pain in that arm and felt as if a snake was
wrapped around his arm and squeezing it. It was not moving
clonically. It is unclear if it was tonic at times.  At about
the same time, his LLE was also weak, but this apparently
started after his arm weakness and only lasted ~25 minutes
before resolving. With all of this, he describes significant
dysarthria. He is unclear about the timing of all of this. He
then normalized, but came to the ED. While here, he had another
episode where his arm felt squeezed and weak again for ~25
minutes. His LLE was not as affected this time. This resolved
and he is currently at baseline.

On admission, he has a mild global headache and feels unsteady
as he has for the last 2 weeks. He has no other issues at this
time.

ROS: Patient denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting,
dysphagia, neck pain, visual changes, hearing changes, chest
pain, shortness of breath, or vertigo.

Imaging:
CXR ([**11-22**]): Unchanged appearance of advanced metastatic
disease, without discrete foci of consolidation. No radiographic
evidence of congestive heart failure.

HCT ([**11-22**]): A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is seen entering the
right frontal region and terminating in the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Again seen is the large left cerebellar mass measuring 22 mm,
similar in appearance to the previous study. It has a smaller
amount of adjacent vasogenic edema. Also seen is the right
cerebellar mass, similar in size, with new high density foci
suggesting interval hemorrhage. Additionally, there is interval
prominence of the extra- axial space outlining the right lateral
frontal cerebral convexity, measuring 5 mm in thickness and
exerting mild mass effect, though there is no shift of the
normally midline structures. The volume of the lateral
ventricles has decreased since the last examination. No evidence
of acute major vascular territorial infarct is identified.
Ethmoid air cells and other sinuses are clear. No fractures are
seen. Burr hole for the right VP shunt noted.
IMPRESSION: 1. Interval appearance of high-density material
within the right cerebellar known metastasis representing
hemorrhage. Similar appearance of left cerebellar metastasis to
last exam. 2. New 5-mm crescentic subdural fluid collection
along the right frontal lateral cerebral convexity, exerting
very mild mass effect.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The right transfrontal VP shunt
is unchanged in position, terminating in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
right lateral ventricle, region of foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**]. However,
there has been a marked change in the appearance of the lateral
ventricular bodies since the [**2118-10-26**] study, which now appear
more slit-like. In additon, there is a moderate-sized subdural
collection layering over the right cerebral convexity, new,
which may be seen with ""intracranial hypotension."" These
findings, in the clinical context, are suggestive of
""over-shunting"".

MRI ([**11-23**]): A right frontal approach ventriculostomy drainage
catheter remains unchanged in position. Three cerebellar
enhancing metastatic lesions are identified, two in the left
cerebellar hemisphere and one in the right. These were present
on the prior examination. The right cerebellar hemisphere lesion
measures 2.7 x 2.4 cm and is largely unchanged. The larger of
the two left cerebellar hemisphere lesions measures 2.6 x 2.7 cm
and is slightly increased in size compared to the prior
examination where it measured approximately 2.6 x 2.2 cm. The
right cerebellar hemispheric lesion has an area of
susceptibility artifact which corresponds to increased
attenuation seen on the recent CT scan. Increased attenuation in
the left cerebellar hemispheric lesion demonstrates decreased
signal intensity on T2-weighted images. No susceptibility
artifact is noted in this left cerebellar hemispheric lesion.
There is a small amount of subdural fluid seen extending over
the entire right cerebral convexity. Post-contrast images
demonstrate dural enhancement over the right cerebral convexity.
The ventricles as seen on the prior recent CT scan are much
smaller in size compared to the CT from [**2118-9-30**]. There is
no change in the position of cerebellar tonsils on the sagittal
image. The suprasellar cistern is normal in appearance.
IMPRESSION: 1. Increased right subdural fluid and enhancement of
the dura with decrease in size of the ventricles suggest
intracranial hypotension. This may be due to over shunting from
the ventricular drainage catheter. 2. Multiple cerebellar
metastatic lesions. The right cerebellar hemispheric lesion has
an area of susceptibility artifact and corresponding to
increased attenuation on the CT suggestive of intratumoral
hemorrhage. The left hemispheric lesion has decreased T2 signal
intensity corresponding to increased attenuation on the CT and
likely represents calcification in a mucinous metastasis.

MRI c-spine: wet read: No evidence of metastatic bone disease to
the C-spine. No cervical cord compression or major cervical
canal stenosis. Mild multilevel degenerative disk changes.

EEG: official read pending, wet read no abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
58yo man with metastatic rectal ca and known cerebellar
metastases and hemorrhage into mets, presents with two discrete
episodes of left arm ""tingling"" or ""twisting"" into extension, no
LOC, lasting 30mins, followed immediately by left leg weakness.
This is most consistent with seizure, possibly from the
right-sided subdural fluid collection seen on MRI. Other
etiologies include hyperglycemia, direct effect from the bleed
in the cerebellum, though this should not cause arm extension,
TIA, though this is less likely, or compression of
brainstem/c-spine, in which he would be expected to have more
cranial nerve findings. He was initially admitted to the ICU for
closer neurologic monitoring given the abnormalities of his
posterior fossa. He was started on keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] and
continued on decadron, with a slightly higher dose of 4mg q8h
(after a 10mg bolus given in the ED). An MRI brain showed three
cerebellar metastases with new hemorrhage into one of these
metastases, as well as a new right-sided subdural fluid
collection and small ventricles. MRI of the cervical spine was
also performed, which showed no evidence of brainstem
compression or cervical canal stenosis. The radiologists raised
the question of overshunting, but this was discussed with the
neurosurgical team and determined to be of no concern and
requiring no change in management.

In addition, he was severely hyperglycemic on arrival in the ED.
He was treated with IVF and an insulin gtt, then started on NPH
with resulting improvement of BS control. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted
for better glycemic control, and he was started on glargine and
sliding scale insulin per their recommendations. He was
discharged to [**Last Name (un) **] for an appointment with diabetic teaching.

His hypertension was treated with metoprolol as with his home
regimen.

vomiting since that time. She has been unable to take anything
by mouth. Since then she has noted a high blood sugars over the
past 24 hours. She uses an insulin pump and has been taking her
insulin and bolusing frequently, but finger stick blood glucose
remained in the high 300s to low 400s, so she became concerned
that that she was in DKA. She has been in DKA a few times in the
past and was worried that she would be unable to keep up with
her fluid requirements given her nausea and vomiting, so she
came into the ED. She attributes the nausea to the tramadol. She

Brief Hospital Course:
34 year old woman with DM type 1 and Hashimoto's thyroiditis who
presented to the ED with nausea, vomiting, and hyperglycemia
concerning for DKA, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for insulin drip.

# DKA: Patient with type 1 diabetes diagnosed in [**2163**]. She
follows with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3636**] at [**Last Name (un) **] and has very good glucose
control at baseline (reports A1c in the 5 range). She was felt
to be in DKA given persistently high FSBG readings at home,
nausea, vomiting, electrolytes demonstrating an anion gap of 20,
and urinalysis with glucose and ketones in the urine on arrival
to the ED. VBG was notable for pH 7.27 and CO2 28.  The etiology
of her DKA is likely secondary to nausea, vomiting, and
resulting hypovolemia from adverse reaction to tramadol that she
had taken for shoulder pain. Unlikely infectious given that she
is afebrile without any localizing symptoms, no dysuria, clean
urinalysis (other than glucose and ketones), no rashes, no
recent illness or sick contacts, no [**Name2 (NI) **] and clear chest x-ray.
Serum glucose on arrival ranged from 350 - 400. She was started
on an insulin drip at 5 units per hour and was bolused 3 L NS in
the ED. As her serum glucose fell below 200, she was
transitioned to D5 water with prn boluses of NS. Lytes were
measured q2 hours until gap resolved the following morning and
D5 was discontinued. Potassium remained within the range of 4.5
to 5.0 with repletion. She was seen by [**Last Name (un) **], who recommended
restarting her home insulin pump at 0.7 units per hour basal
with i:[**Doctor Last Name **] 1:15, CF 40, and target of 120.  She remained
hyperglycemic on these settings, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommended
increasing her basal rate to 0.9 units/hr, i:[**Doctor Last Name **] to 1:12 and CF
to 35.  She was scheduled for a follow up appointment with
[**Last Name (un) **].

# Right rotator cuff pain: Patient has rotator cuff injury for
which she is seeing ortho. She has outpatient cortisone
injection scheduled for early [**Month (only) 359**]. She was prescribed
tramadol (which she had never taken) for pain refractory to
ibuprofen, and developed nausea and vomiting which likely
precipitated DKA (above). She was continued on ibuprofen,
started on acetaminophen standing, and instructed on physical
therapy exercises to help with pain and range of motion. She has
ortho follow up already scheduled for early [**Month (only) 359**].

# Hashimotos thyroiditis: She is euthyroid on exam and was
continued on her home dose of levothyroxine 50 mcg PO daily.

# Insomnia: Patient recently started taking Zoloft for insomnia.
She denies symptoms of depression.

# FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, insulin drip

# Prophylaxis: SQH, pneumoboots

# Contact: [**Name (NI) 4906**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 43474**]

# Code: Full (confirmed)

# Transitional issues:
- Patient will need close PCP/endocrine follow up given DKA
- Basal settings for insulin pump changed in consultation with
[**Last Name (un) **]: 0.9 units/hr, i:[**Doctor Last Name **] to 1:12 and CF to 35 -- this should
be discussed with [**Last Name (un) **] provider at follow up appointment

Dear Ms. [**Last Name (Titles) 6129**],

You came into the ED because of nausea, vomiting, hyperglycemia,
and were found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). You were
admitted to the ICU because you were required an insulin drip.
You were also given several liters of fluid and your blood
sugars came back down to normal. We monitored you overnight and
your symptoms resolved and  your sugars were controlled with
your home insulin pump.

You were also complaining of shoulder pain from your right
rotator cuff and you are scheduled for follow up with ortho to
have a cortisone injection.  You should not take tramadol any
longer due to the adverse reaction of nausea and vomiting which
may have caused you to go into DKA.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 20 year old female with h/o ESRD secondary to
SLE. She is currently on HD through a L IJ tunnelled catheter on
MWF @ [**Hospital1 1426**]. She was dialysed on the day of admission and at
the end of dialysis her  her post HD BP was 230-240s and she
also experienced a bitemporal headache with blurry vision.
Also, she described transient CP sensation for 1 minute at HD.
.
In ED she was noted to have SBP to 250s and was given
phentolamine X2, clonopine PO and patch, hydralazine with
minimal effect. A CT head showed no evidence of bleed.  A
nipride gtt was started with some effect with SBP falling
transiently to 190.
.
On arrival to MICU, pt was switched to labetalol gtt out of
concern for potential toxicity on nipride.  Labetalol was
effective initially but pt did have SBP to 230.  Pt had
witnessed, tonic clonic seizure for 30 seconds with + tongue
biting  and spontaneous resolution + post-ictal state.  Pt had
repeat head CT negative and neuro eval who found pt
neurologically intact and recommended holding on dilantin and
getting MR head with GAD in AM to r/o posterior

.
Pt had second seizure lasting 2-3 minutes and was given 2mg IV
ativan with good effect.  Dilantin IV 1gm load given.
Additional labs returned with phos at 1.1 so PO and IV repletion
started.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/p 20 yo F with ESRD on HD who p/w hypertensive crisis and has
new onset seizure
.
1) Hypertensive emergency
Her blood pressure was controlled with a labetaolol drip and she
was then transitioned to po labetalol. She was also continued on
the clonidine patch. In light of her complaints of chest pain we
were reassured by her ECG and by her flat cardiac enzymes.
.
2) New onset seizure
We thought that her new onset seizures were probably due to her
severely elevated blood pressure but other diagnoses including
lupus cerbritis were also considered.
An MRI with gadolinium was obtained.  It demonstrated abnormal
T2 and FLAIR signal within both occipital and parietal lobes in
a pattern suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy
syndrome. We consulted the rheumatology service who thought that
her presentation was more consistent with hypertensive
encephalopathy rather lupus cerebritis. She was loaded with
dilantin. With dilantin loading and control of her blood
pressure she did not have a recurrence of her seizures.
.
3) Lupus:
She was continued on her plaquenil and prednisone.
.
4) ESRD
She continued to receive regulary scheduled hemodialysis.
.
5) Knee Pain:
On the day of discharge the patient complained of L knee pain.
On physical exam she was afebrile, the knee was slightly warm
and tender to the touch without obvious effusion. An X ray of
the knee was read as normal. She had full range of motion but it
was painful but she was able to bear weight on it. She was
instructed to use tylenol prn for pain and to return o the
clinic or emergency room should she develop worsening knee pain,
fevers or chills.
.
Communicaton:
The patient and the patient's mother were extensively counselled
about the patient's disease. She demonstrated an understanding
of the importance of good medical compliance with therapy and
keeping appointments.

Date of Birth:   [**2041-11-27**]       Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old male with
no medical care for the last ten years, who had sudden onset
of dyspnea while riding his bike.  He had positive
palpitations, no chest pain, no nausea or vomiting or
diaphoresis.  He stopped and rested, with no relief.

He entered the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency
Department and was found to have an oxygen saturation of 70%.
Electrocardiogram showed no complex tachycardia, with an
elevated blood pressure.  Adenosine was given with no effect.
It was given again, and he was broken to normal sinus rhythm
with a rate of 80s.  Chest x-ray showed congestive heart
failure at that time, and he was started on a nitro drip,
given aspirin and lasix, and the patient improved.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Questionable hypertension, which was
untreated, arthritis, essential tremor.

MEDICATIONS:  Ibuprofen as needed.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission:  Afebrile,
heart rate in the 80s, blood pressure normal, oxygen
saturation 98% on 3 liters.  He was alert and oriented, no
jugular venous distention was noted.  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  He had crackles halfway up the lung
fields.  His cardiovascular examination showed distant heart
sounds, regular rate and rhythm, with no murmurs, gallops or
rubs.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel
sounds present.  The extremities were warm and well perfused,
with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 16.5, hematocrit 46.0, platelet
count 362.  Sodium 141, potassium 3.2, chloride 101,
bicarbonate 20, BUN 12, creatinine 0.9, glucose 101.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
service and begun workup of congestive heart failure.  The
patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory,
which showed three vessel disease and was planned for
coronary artery bypass graft at that time.  EP studies were
also done at that time due to his narrow complex
supraventricular tachycardia requiring adenosine.

During the catheterization, it was found that the patient had
moderate aortic insufficiency and it was planned that he
would have an AVR at the same time.

On [**2102-10-12**], the patient was taken to the operating room,
where a coronary artery bypass graft x 3 and AVR was
performed.  The patient was transferred to the CSRU
postoperatively.  He did well.  The patient was weaned from
his ventilator and was extubated and continued to improve.
His Foley was removed.  His chest tube was removed.

The patient was noted to have supraventricular tachycardia
postoperatively, which was broken with adenosine.  Lopressor
was started in order to control his supraventricular
tachycardia, however, the patient continued to have repeat
episodes of supraventricular tachycardia.  He was kept in the
Intensive Care Unit for monitoring and for administration of
adenosine.  EP was following at this time, and it was planned
for a workup.  His Lopressor was increased, but again had no
effect.

The patient was taken to the EP laboratory on [**2102-10-17**], where
he was studied and found to have a pathway which was
successfully ablated.  Physical Therapy was consulted for
ambulation, and the patient did well, and it was felt that
the patient would be safe to be discharged home.

After his ablation, the patient was transferred to the floor,
where he did well.  On postoperative day number six, the
patient had no further episodes of supraventricular
tachycardia, and his heart rate was stable.  The patient was
able to clear stairs with physical therapy, and the patient
was discharged home in stable condition.

The patient is instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in
four weeks, and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] of Cardiology in two to
four weeks, and his primary care physician in one to two
weeks.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg by mouth twice a day
2.  Lasix 20 mg by mouth twice a day
3.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq by mouth twice a day
4.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice a day
5.  Zantac 150 mg by mouth twice a day
6.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily
7   Percocet one to two tablets by mouth every four hours as
needed

The patient is discharged in stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Supraventricular tachycardia status post ablation
2.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft x 3

The patient is discharged in stable condition to home, and is
instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in four weeks, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 284**] in two to four weeks, and his primary care

apraxia.  Face is symmetric without ptosis.  Extraocular
muscles are intact.  Pupils 4 to 3 bilaterally.  The
patient's upper extremities were full strength.  Left lower
extremity full strength as well.

LABORATORY:  An MRI / MRA was done that showed right
vertebral artery stenosis.

White blood cell count 8.5, hematocrit 47, platelets 162.
Sodium 133, BUN 27, creatinine 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) **] Service.  He underwent an angiogram on [**4-27**].  This
showed intracranial stenosis of the right V4 vertebral
segment.

This was discussed with the patient.  The risks and benefits
of this procedure were explained to the patient.  He wished
to proceed.

Preoperative diagnosis again was right intracranial vertebral
artery stenosis.

Procedure that the patient underwent was:
1.  Cerebral angiogram.
2.  Angioplasty and stent deployment within the right
vertebral artery stenosis segment.

This operation was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1132**] and was
characterized by a prolonged decreased right vertebral flow
because of the need for the guide catheter to be high enough in
the neck to allow PTA balloon and  stent navigation to the site
of stenosis.

The patient awoke with right arm and leg hemiplegia.  A STAT
head CT scan was performed to rule out hemorhhage and that
was negative.

Over the next couple of hours, the patient recovered
excellent strength in the right arm and leg back to normal
baseline strength, a finding most consistent with relative
reversible hypoperfusion of his brainstem intra-procedurally
because of the guide catheter position.

The patient was continued on heparin, Plavix and aspirin post
procedure.  The heparin was discontinued on [**5-3**].  The
patient's arterial sheath was also discontinued on [**5-3**].
The patient did well.  He was transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit.

He was continued on aspirin and Plavix and did well on the
floor and was stable for discharge to home on [**2136-5-6**].

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1132**] in one
month.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient will be discharged on all
his preoperative medications.
1.  Zestril 30 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  He will also be discharged on Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Add aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.

It has been explained to the patient the absolute necessity
that he take these medications every day.

History of Present Illness:
29M with h/o R staghorn calculus and R ureteral stent c/b
pyelonephritis, now s/p ureteroscopy and lithotripsy, admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation after apnea and hypoxia
post-extubation.  Per Urology, he had elective ureteroscopy and
lithotripsy for a R kidney stone.  He tolerated the procedure
well.  In the OR, he was given ceftazidime, as he has a h/o
resistant E. coli pyelonephritis and bacteremia in [**6-12**], and
1.5L LR.  In the PACU, he was extubated.  He subsequently became
tachypneic to RR 30s, with sats 89-90% on 2-3L NC, BP 160s/90s.
He was placed on 6L FM with sats increasing to 95%.  He coughed
up pink frothy sputum.  There was a question as to whether the
patient was given an extra 1L of LR. He had bilateral crackles
on exam.  He was given 40IV Lasix, to which he put out 1L urine
over 45 minutes.  His tachypnea resolved and his sats improved
to 95% on 3-4L NC.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory distress: Sudden desaturation, frothy pink sputum,
and improvement with diuresis suggest acute pulmonary edema.  He
was documented to be hypertensive in the PACU records, but it is
unclear whether this developed before or after his respiratory
decompensation.  He has no history of hypertension or cardiac
disease.  Could also be due to vigorous IVF in the OR.  There
have also been anesthesia case reports of pulmonary contusion
secondary to ESWL, presenting with hemoptysis and consolidation
on CXR, neither of which is apparent here.  He responded well to
diuresis and was quickly weaned off O2 in the ICU.  His ECG was
within normal limits. cardiac enzymes were negative x 1 (except
for ck 424 neg mb)
.
# Nephrolithiasis:  He has a history of R staghorn calculus,
complicated by obstruction s/p R ureteral stent placement and
subsequent E. coli pyelonephritis and bacteremia.  He is now s/p
elective ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.  He tolerated the
procedure well and had good urine output.  He was discharged on
prn pyridium and Percocet for postprocedure discomfort, as well
as 1 week of prophylactic Bactrim per Urology recommendations.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
Congestive heart failure, for Milrinone taper.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old
African American man who is admitted from the catheterization
laboratory after an attempted wean of his intravenous
Milrinone.  The patient is maintained on a continuous
infusion of Milrinone for systolic heart failure secondary to
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  In the spring of [**2148**] the
patient deteriorated and became hypotensive with shortness of
breath and fatigue.  These occurred with minimal exertion.
The patient improved on intravenous Milrinone, but was unable
to be weaned.  He was evaluated for trans pump, but was felt
to be not a candidate as he would likely require left
ventricular assist device and the patient will not accept
blood products as he is a Jehovah's witness.  The patient has
been maintained on intravenous home Milrinone since [**2148-1-16**].  Subsequently the patient underwent revision of his DDD
pacemaker to a synchronized pacing.  The patient reports that
this improved his symptoms dramatically.  Previously he could
only walk a few steps, after that he was able to walk
approximately one mile on the treadmill every other day
without fatigue.  The patient is able to perform activities
of daily living as well as a climb a flight of stairs without
symptoms.  He also notes he has lowered the head of his bed
to two pillows without symptoms.  Previously he had been
sleeping on three to four pillows or upright.  Currently the
patient denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower
extremity edema, chest pain.  He has no fevers or chills,
dizziness, upper respiratory infections symptoms or diarrhea.
 He has no urinary symptoms.  He denies blood in his stool.
He denies nausea or vomiting.  He does note an occasional
sensation of fluttering in his chest when he lays on his
back.  He states this is long standing.  The patient was
admitted for elective cardiac catheterization and for
attempted milrinone wean given his risk of sudden death and
infection.  The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed in
the catheterization laboratory.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Dilated cardiomyopathy (please see history of present
illness for details).
2.  Severe mitral regurgitation.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  History of supraventricular tachycardia on Holter monitor
in [**2148-1-16**].
5.  Chronic gastritis with a history of H pylori, which has
been treated.
6.  History of positive PPD.
7.  Chronic renal failure.
8.  Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
9.  Severe pulmonary hypertension.
10.  History of left bundle branch block.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Captopril 12.5 mg po t.i.d.,
Aldactone 12.5 mg po q.d., Amiodarone 200 mg po q day, Coreg

are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Bowel sounds are
present.  The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities there is no peripheral edema.  Peripheral pulses
are palpable bilaterally.  He has a line in his right groin.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 3.2, hematocrit 33.0,
platelets 180, INR 1.3, PT 14.2, PTT 29.9, sodium 139,
potassium 3.6, chloride 103, bicarb 28, BUN 21, creatinine
1.4 with a baseline of 1.4 to 1.7, glucose 110, calcium 8.5,
phosphate 3.5, magnesium 1.6, ALT 23, AST 27, alkaline
phosphatase 51, total bilirubin 0.5.  His Digoxin level is
1.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient initially
had cardiac catheterization performed. This revealed a normal
filling pressures with marked improvement of the pulmonary
artery pressure compared with the prior catheterization.
However, the patient did have baseline depression of his
cardiac index on his Milrinone infusion.  The Milrinone was
decreased to half strength and there was no significant drop
in his cardiac index.  The patient was therefore transferred
to the Coronary Care Unit for further hemodynamic monitoring.
 The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed while in the
catheterization laboratory.  His Milrinone was continued to
be tapered while the patient was in the Coronary Care Unit.
His hemodynamics were monitored q two hours.  The patient's
Milranone was successfully weaned off during the patient's
first day in the Coronary Care Unit, however, the patient was
noted to have a low cardiac index with falling blood
pressures once the Milrinone was taken off.  Therefore the
decision was made to restart his Milrinone at his previous
dose of 0.33 micrograms per kilogram per minute.  The patient
had his Swan-Ganz catheter removed under fluoroscopy.

2.  Rhythm:  The patient has a biventricular pacemaker.  He
had no issues during his stay in the hospital.  His Swan-Ganz
was removed under fluoroscopic guidance as he has a
pacemaker.

3.  Hematology:  The patient was started on heparin drip
after his procedure. His Coumadin was restarted while he was
in house.  He will continue to take his Coumadin once he is
discharged to home.

4.  History of gastritis:  The patient was continued on
Protonix.

5.  Renal:  The patient's chronic renal failure was at
baseline with a creatinine between 1.3 and 1.5 while the
patient was admitted.

6.  Hypotension:  The patient was noted to be hypotensive
during this admission with systolic blood pressures ranging
from the low 80s to 90s.  The patient was asymptomatic with
these blood pressures.  He was encouraged to increase his po
intake.  He was encouraged to consume eight glasses of liquid
per day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.
2.  Severe mitral regurgitation.
3.  Hypotension.
4.  Chronic gastritis.
5.  Chronic renal failure.
6.  History of left bundle branch block.
7.  History of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
8.  Severe pulmonary hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  the same as admission medications.
It should be noted that the patient is continuing on his
continuous infusion of Milrinone at 0.33 micrograms per
kilogram per minute.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with his
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3510**] to have his INR
checked in three days.  He will also follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the heart failure clinic in three to four weeks.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

Brief Hospital Course:
#) UGIB: Upper endoscopy showed proximal duodenal ulcers with
clean bases. [**Month (only) 116**] have been [**12-26**] NSAID use as patient was on
motrin 800 TID for shoulder pain. Received 2 units of PRBCs w/
appropriate response.  Then, he had 1 large melenotic BM w/
subsequent 4 point drop in Hct.  He received another 2U PRBC,
and his Hct stablized at 30 for >24 hours.  He had no further
episodes of bleeding or guaiac + stools; vitals stable during
his admission.  Would continue protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] for next 2
months and avoid all NSAIDs.
.
#) Major Depression with recent suicide attempt: Pt did not
exhibit any behavior suggestive of psychosis or depression
during this admission; had 1:1 sitter at all times.  Seen by
in-house psychiatrist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14936**]. She noted that he
may have depression with elements of psychosis, and
significantly, that he has no insight regarding this event.
Lithium was initially held [**12-26**] to renal failure but restarted
after this issue resolved.  RPR was negative for ?syphillis, and
pt was continued on celexa and abilify.  Pt will follow up with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 95664**] at [**Hospital6 1597**].  He will need to
have his Lithium levels checked by that time - within range at
0.8 prior to discharge.
.
#) s/p falls: Fell twice at [**Hospital1 **], reports hitting his
head.  ?LOC. Head Ct negative. X-ray of face/orbits were
negative.  Also complains of left shoulder pain, which is more
chronic - X-ray negative.  Pain controlled w/ prn tylenol;
avoiding NSAIDs.
.
#) Renal Failure: Cr 2.9 on admission - baseline unknown -
therefore unclear duration, however, most likely related to
hypovolemia. Resolved with hydration.
.
#) Leukocytosis: Pt's WBC elevated to 17 initially, but he was
afebrile and had no obvious source of infection.  White count
likely elevated due to stress response from GIB.  Resolved after
receiving PRBC transfusions; slowly rising again to 12 on day of
discharge, but he had no evidence of further bleeding was
hemodynamically stable.
.
#) HTN. Anti-hypertensives initally held given orthostatic
hypotension and GI bleed.  Restarted HCTZ for elevated blood
pressure.  Lisinopril not given currently for BP range of
112-146/64-86.  Could restart if BP elevated >140/90.
.
#) Constipation: Appears to be chronic. Had multiple BM since
admission w/ help of colace and prn senna.
.
#) FEN: Regular diet
.
#) PPX: ambulation, colace
.
#) Code: Full
.

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
woman with a sudden onset of blinding headache on the day of
admission with no neck pain, nausea, vomiting, blurry vision
or trauma.  She had no chest pain or shortness of breath or
dizziness.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
GENERAL:  She is awake, alert and oriented x3.
VITAL SIGNS:  Her temperature was 96??????, heart rate 62, blood
pressure 131/72, respiratory rate 18.  Saturations were 99%
on room air.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Her pupils equal, round
and reactive to light.
NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  On
motor strength, she had no pronator drift and she was [**6-6**] in
all muscle groups.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  She had a S1 and S2, no S3 or S4.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

CT showed subarachnoid hemorrhage.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the Neurosurgical
Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure control.  On
[**2106-6-11**], she underwent a coiling of a right posterior
communicating artery aneurysm.  Coiling was successful and
the patient was monitored in the Neurologic Intensive Care
Unit for 10 days to watch for vasospasm.  The patient had no
episodes of vasospasm while in the Intensive Care Unit.  Her
vital signs remained stable.  She was afebrile.  She did have
complaints of headache on and off.  She was medicated with
Percocet.  She had transcranial Dopplers which showed some
mild elevation, but no clinical evidence of vasospasm.  She
had repeat arteriogram on [**2106-6-18**] which showed no evidence
of vasospasm.

The patient continued to be monitored for blood pressure
monitoring and was started on Neo-Synephrine to keep her
blood pressure greater than 150.  On [**2106-6-19**], the patient
had a temperature of 101.2?????? and she was started on
ceftriaxone for left lower lobe pneumonia.  The patient
developed loose stools, most likely it was thought to be
related to her lactose intolerance, however it persisted
after lactose diet was initiated and a Clostridium difficile
toxin was sent.  The patient is on a 10 day course of
ceftriaxone and she is day 7 of 10 days.  She was transferred
to the regular floor on [**2106-6-23**].  She remains in stable
condition.  She was seen by physical therapy and occupational
therapy and found to require rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Percocet 1 to 2 tablets po q4h prn
2.  Ceftriaxone 2 gm intravenous q 24 hours to be continued

Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac catheterization with stent placement
2. Central line placement


History of Present Illness:
57 yo man with renal cancer metastatic to the lungs receiving
IL-2 therapy with multiple cardiac risk factors including
tobacco use, +FHx of MI by father in his 50s, possibly
uncontrolled cholesterol, HTN, and overweight developed acute
substernal CP the morning of admission. EKG showed Lateral ST
elevations in leads I & aVL along with a new Left IVCD.
Cardiology was called for urgent consultation. The patient had
an ECHO which only showed a mildly depressed EF of 40-45% but
had mild hypokinesis of inferior/lateral walls. Cardiology
initially felt that the patient is not a cardiac catheterization
candidate b/c of his low platelets and high creatinine. The
patient will be medically treated in the ICU to monitor for
ongoing CP & cardiac monitoring.

He was intially admitted on [**9-1**] for elective IL-2 infusions for
treatment of metastatic renal cell ca. He had a central line
placed by general surgery on [**9-1**], started IL-2 infusions, and
had 12 infusions over last few days, last given [**2188-9-5**] at 8 am.
His hospital course was complicated by temp to 102 on [**9-2**]
(thought to be infusion-related), ongoing diarrhea,
nausea/vomiting (given anzemet), and acute renal failure
(treated w/ fluids). He had an episode of hypotension the day
prior to admission (thought to be IL-2 related) and was briefly
on neo from [**12-20**] pm yesterday. Two doses of IL-2 were held [**1-16**]
hypotension. The morning of admission/transfer, he patient
complained of substernal chest pain and had EKG changes
described above. He was given 1 SL nitro, aspirin, with
alleviation of pain. Trop >7, CK pending.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient awoke with 2/10 CP (""fullness"" more
than CP), nonradiating, pleuritic in nature. The pain was
previously worse and improved with SL NTG. He denied SOB, F/C,
N/V, abdominal pain, diaphoresis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 57 yo man with metastatic renal cancer to the lungs
s/p IL-2 treatment with STEMI s/p stenting of LAD and LCX
complicated by respiratory distress requiring intubation.

Hospital course is reviewed by problem:

1. STEMI vs. myocarditis: Initially it was unclear whether his
chest pain was secondary to an STEMI or myocarditis. However,
after the cardiac catheterization that showed LAD and LCx
disease, as well as the elevated cardiac enzymes and improvement
in chest pain with stents, this was most likely an STEMI.
Initially, this was medically managed due to high creatinine and
low platelets, but he continued to have chest pain. The patient
underwent stenting of the lesions in his LAD and LCx. He was
started on ASA and plavix, metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **], and pravastatin
20mg. This was initially held given a transaminitis, but after
discussion with the primary oncology team he was placed on the
statin. It is possible that the STEMI was a side effect of the
IL-2 therapy. This has been reported once in the past and is
thought to be secondary to the significant cytokine effect. As
such, he was determined to be a poor candidate for future IL-2
therapy.
.
2. Congestive heart failure: The patient initially was
transferred to the CCU with clinical volume overload. He was
able to autodiurese and did not need to be continued on lasix.
He had an ECHO which showed an EF of 30-35% with new anterior
wall hypokinesis.
.
3. Respiratory distress: He was noted to be in respiratory
distress and needed to be intubated. This was likely secondary
to volume overload, and he was shortly extubated. He was off any
oxygen at discharge.
.
4. Hypotension: He had several episodes of hypotension while in
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. He initially needed to be treated with pressors, but
this eventually resolved and he was taken off the drips. The
hypotension was thought to be secondary to decreased SVR.
Etiology could have been sepsis - his sputum cx grew GNRs. Blood
and urine cx negative. He was not treated with any antibiotics,
but his hypotension resolved.
.
5. Acidosis: He was noted to have a nongap acidosis, which
resolved. This was thought to be secondary to a renal cause.
.
6. Renal cell cancer: He was treated with IL-2 therapy, then
supportive care once he was post-chemo. He was followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1729**], who decided that they would not continue any more
iterations of IL-2, given that it may have precipitated his MI.
The patient was discharged with oncology outpatient follow-up.
.
7. Acute renal failure: He was noted to have an elevation in his
creatinine, with the peak at 3.4. This was likely secondary to
IL-2, and it fell after treatment to 1.3 on discharge.
.
8. Acute liver failure: This was also thought likely secondary
to IL-2 or shock-liver from an MI. His LFTs trended down after
his catheterization, with significantly lower values at
discharge (ALT 64, AST 36, LDH 673, AP 139, TBili 2.8 from 128,
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 64407**], 155, 7.3 respectively).
.
9. Elevated amylase and lipase - amylase and lipase were
elevated to 172 and 641. This may have been secondary to
pancreatitis from low flow state to pancreas during MI. During
the hospitalization, he denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
and did not have any difficulty with po intake.
.
10. Thrombocytopenia: Likely secondary to IL-2. Plt count
dropped to 21 but were in the 90s at discharge.
.

progression of her Crohn's disease since a prior study of
[**2200-6-2**].  EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 133 beats per
minute with normal axis, poor R wave progression in the
anterior leads, flattening and T wave inversions new compared
with EKG of [**2200-6-13**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Miss [**Known lastname 3647**] is a 33-year-old female with a
history of Crohn's disease, admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] initially to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for weight loss, lightheadedness, chest pain, increasing
diarrhea in the setting of radiologic evidence for
progression of her Crohn's disease.

1.  GI:  Miss [**Known lastname **] symptoms were consistent with an
exacerbation of her Crohn's disease.  A GI consult was
obtained with the recommendations of continuing her Pentasa
and starting a two week course of Cipro and Flagyl.  She was
made npo and started TPN and IV Solu-Medrol drip at 2 mg per
hour.  There was discussion at that time about starting
Remicade, however, it was felt best to be deferred given her
multiple perirectal abscesses and a questionable infection at
that site.  On hospital day #3 she was taken to the operating
room for an examination under anesthesia and excision of skin
tag.  There were no signs of active infection at the time and
showed a well healing surgical scar from prior drainage of
perirectal abscesses.  On hospital day #4 she was switched to
po from IV Solu-Medrol drip to po Prednisone after the
surgery.  Again, on hospital day #4 after surgery and after
stabilization of her cardiovascular status she was
transferred to the regular floor and continued treatment for
Crohn's disease.  Throughout the hospital course she was
started on TPN and continued with Pentasa, Cipro/Flagyl and
po Prednisone.  On hospital day #6 at the suggestion of the
GI consult team, she was taken for flexible sigmoidoscopy
which showed ulceration erythema with lesion and cobblestone
pattern in the descending colon, rectum and sigmoid colon
compatible with a Crohn's disease.  Over the subsequent three
days prior to hospital discharge, the patient was started on
fluid intake which she advanced slowly over the course of
three days.  Over that time she was decreased in the volume
of TPN that she received with no increase of her bowel
movements.  At the time of hospital discharge she was noting
[**7-11**] bowel movements that were watery and light brown in
color.  This was prior very dark, bloody bowel movements.
She was not having any abdominal pain with meals and no
fevers or chills overnight.  She was discharged to home with
a follow-up with her new primary care provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], on
[**8-27**] at 1:30 p.m.  She was asked to continue Cipro and Flagyl
for a two week total dosage.  She was asked to continue
steroid with a taper, continue her Prednisone at 40 mg po q d
in a taper of 5 mg a week and continue her Pentasa as an
outpatient.  In addition, she has a follow-up appointment
with GI, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2987**], two weeks after discharge.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient presented with profound
hypertension to systolic blood pressure of 80's and was
started on Levophed.  It was felt her hypotension was a
combination of hypovolemia, anemia, and possible sepsis.  She
was supported well with IV fluids and antibiotics.  By
hospital day #2 her blood pressure and heart rate responded
well such that the Levophed was discontinued.  By hospital
day #2 her blood pressure and heart rate were stable and IV
fluids were continued only at maintenance levels.  She had no
EKG changes throughout the course and no further episodes of
chest pain or hypotension throughout the rest of her hospital
course.

3.  ID:  Miss [**Known lastname **] profound hypertension and tachycardia
was thought also possibly consistent with a sepsis type
picture in the setting of a Crohn's flare.  She was started
on Flagyl 500 mg IV tid and Ciprofloxacin 200 mg IV bid.
This was maintained through her hospital course.  She had an
elevated white count, as high as 13.7 during hospital course
and it was felt secondary to Solu-Medrol.  She had several
stool studies done throughout the course of her hospital
course, however, all stool studies were negative.  At the
time of hospital discharge the patient was switched to po
Cipro/Flagyl and was asked to continue those for two week
total course.  She was afebrile with a normal white count at
the time of hospital discharge.

4.  Hematologic:  Miss [**Known lastname 3647**] presents to the hospital with
hematocrit of 31.7, it fell subsequently over the course of
two days to 23.9, however, this was in the setting of several
liters of IV fluids and it was felt secondary to dilutional
effects from the IV fluids.  On hospital day #2 she received
two units of packed red blood cells with appropriate response
in her hematocrit to 28.3.  This was felt to be approximately
her baseline and her hematocrit was followed through the
duration of her hospital course and was stable.  At the time
of discharge her hematocrit was 28.9 and stable.

5.  Chronic renal insufficiency:  Miss [**Known lastname 3647**] has history of
chronic renal insufficiency felt secondary to Lithium use in
the past.  Her baseline creatinine is reportedly 1.5 to 2.0.
At the time of admission her creatinine of 2.4 was felt
secondary to profound hypovolemia.  Her creatinine returned
to baseline with hydration and at the time of discharge was
back to baseline level of 1.4.  She will continue to have
this followed as an outpatient with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

6.  Psychiatry:  Miss [**Known lastname 3647**] carries a psychiatric diagnoses
of depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, schizo-affective disorder.
On hospital day #3 she was continued on her outpatient
medications of Seroquel and Zyprexa.  On hospital day #2
psychiatry team was consulted and it was felt that she had
chronic psychiatric disorder that involved psychotic features
in the past.  She appeared currently stable with no evidence
of active depression, hypomania, mania, psychosis,
suicidality or other psychiatric disturbances.  The issue of
medication non compliance was addressed and Miss [**Known lastname 3647**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 2771**] the non compliance to the side effects of
abdominal pain and vomiting.  She appeared agreeable to
taking her necessary medications if she tolerates them.
Throughout the course of her hospitalization she was
continued on her Zyprexa and Seroquel without any psychiatric
events and at discharge she did not appear depressed or
particularly anxious.  She denied any suicidal or homicidal
ideation.  She was to follow-up with her outpatient
psychiatrist.

Miss [**Known lastname 3647**] is discharged to home in good condition with
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], her primary physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**8-27**] at
1:30 p.m. and a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2987**],
gastroenterology, two weeks after discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Prednisone 40 mg po q d, then taper 5
mg per week, Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid times 6 weeks, then
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po q d times 6 weeks, Flagyl 500 mg po
tid times four weeks, Pentasa 1,000 mg po qid.  All
medications that were taken prior to hospitalization were
continued.
